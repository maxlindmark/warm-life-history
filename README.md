[Lindmark, M.](https://maxlindmark.github.io/), Karlsson, M., and [GÃ¥rdmark, A](https://internt.slu.se/en/cv-originals/anna-gardmark/). 2023, January 9. Larger but younger fish when growth outpaces mortality in heated ecosystem. bioRxiv. <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.13.488128v3> (Accessed 18 January 2023).

This repo contains R code for analyzing individual growth data and catch per unit effort data in the heated Biotest Lake and the surrounding reference area, to investigate how warming has affected growth, size structure and mortality of perch.

We fit linear and non-linear hierarchical Bayesian models using the R-package [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) to analyse growth and mortality rates, and the R-package [sizeSpectra](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/sizeSpectra) for fitting size spectra to catch data using maximum likelihood methods, following [*Edwards* et al. 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12641/full) and [*Edwards* et al. 2020](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v636/p19-33/).


## How to replicate our analyses and navigate this repo
From scratch:
`data/raw`
The raw data are available from the database KUL for some of the years: https://www.slu.se/institutioner/akvatiska-resurser/databaser/kul/ and the rest is hosted by SLU. Note that this data need some work before it is usable. Individual data were collated in [Huss et al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14637). If you have any questions about these data (e.g., translating column names or how to use it), please, feel free to reach out to us. We suggest, however, that you start directly from the scripts in `R/analysis` and use the already cleaned data. 

`data/cleaned`
Contains merged and cleaned data, see scripts 00_age_length_key.Rmd and 00_process_catch_data.Rmd in `R/clean_data`).

`data/for_fitting`
Contains data ready to go directly into model fitting scripts (`R/analysis`). These files are created in scripts in `R/clean_data` starting with 01-04 (1 = von Bertalanffy, 2 = growth size scaling, 3 = catch curves, 4 = size-spectra).

`R/analysis`
Contains R code for fitting models (using data in `data/for_fitting`), plotting and creating figures.

`figures`
Contains all main and supporting figures (`figures/supp`)

You can also download this repo and view knitted html files of all .Rmd scripts, or e.g., start directly from the scripts in `R/analysis` and use the already cleaned data.
