# The effect of warming on life history traits of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and its implications for population age- and size structure

This repo contains R code for analyzing individual growth data and catch per unit effort data in the heated Biotest Lake and surrounding reference area, to investigate how warming has affected growth and longevity of perch, and how that affects population size structure.

We fit linear and non-linear hierarchical Bayesian models using the package [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms).

## How to replicate our analyses and navigate this repo

`data`
Data are not uploaded here due to being large. They are available from database KUL: https://www.slu.se/institutioner/akvatiska-resurser/databaser/kul/ and shared driver at SLU ("G:")) and from local drives. Individual data were collated in Huss et al (2018). Can also be sent upon request (e-mail author as files are big)

`R`
Contains code for analysis and data processing

`figures`
Contains figures of results

`output`
Contains .rds objects of model outputs due to long compuation times
